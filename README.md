# FS Blocks

A Gutenberg friendly WordPress Theme by Thomas Villain @ anybodesign.com

## Theme Options

### One-Page

In the Customizer, you can make your website a one-page. Then, all your pages will be displayed on the front page and the main navigation menu will be automaticaly created. Menu items will scroll to their section.
It is recommanded that you set a front page and a page for posts.
You can sort your pages with the [Simple Custom Post Order] (https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-custom-post-order/) plugin for example.

### Carousel of posts

You can display all your posts as a carousel (only work when the one-page option is set).

### Colors

You can set 3 different colors: 
* The primary one should be dark enough to support white text. 
* The secondary one will used as background color for sections (with a low opacity) and color for links. 
* The contrast colors can be used for styling blocks in the new editor.

### Page templates

Some page templates can be useful.
* Animated image: the featured image is set to 50% of the screen width and is slightly animated.
* Standalone page: with the one-page option set, this kind of page will not appear in the main navigation menu, but will link to another page.

## Menus

There are two navigation menus locations: _main menu_ in the header and _footer menu_ in the footer :)
When the one-page option is set, the main menu location is used to display your pages.

## Widgets

There are two widgets area: one for the sidebar and one for the footer.
